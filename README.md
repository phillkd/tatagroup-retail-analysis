# Retail Revenue Insights: Tata Group Case Study

## üìå Project Overview  
This project was part of a job simulation for Tata Group, focused on analyzing retail store performance using a dataset of transactions. The goal was to support business decisions by cleaning raw data, identifying key revenue trends, and presenting insights through clear visualizations.

I was tasked with uncovering trends in revenue across countries, identifying top-performing customers and products, and analyzing product demand by region. The final output was a Power BI dashboard tailored for executive decision-makers.

## Dataset Overview  
The dataset represented retail transaction data from 2010‚Äì2011 and included the following columns:

- `Invoice No`
- `Stock Code`
- `Description`
- `Quantity`
- `Invoice Date`
- `Unit Price`
- `Customer ID`
- `Country`

The dataset had missing values, irregularities, and required cleaning before use.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Steps taken in Power BI (Power Query):

- Removed rows with missing `Customer ID`
- Filtered out transactions with non-positive Quantity or Price
- Converted `Invoice Date` to proper datetime format
- Extracted `Month` and `Year` for time-based analysis
- Standardized column headers for clarity
